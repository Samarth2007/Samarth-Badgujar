<font size="5"><font color="Green">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.
<h1><font color="Blue"> How does the new coronavirus spread? </h1>
<font size="5"><font color="Green">As of now, researchers know that the new coronavirus is spread through droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The droplets generally do not travel more than a few feet, and they fall to the ground (or onto surfaces) in a few seconds — this is why physical distancing is effective in preventing the spread.
<h1><font color="Blue"> How did this new coronavirus spread to humans? </h1>
<font size="5"><font color="Green">COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, a city in China, in December 2019. Although health officials are still tracing the exact source of this new coronavirus, early hypotheses thought it may be linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, China. Some people who visited the market developed viral pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus. A study that came out on Jan. 25, 2020, notes that the individual with the first reported case became ill on Dec. 1, 2019, and had no link to the seafood market. Investigations are ongoing as to how this virus originated and spread.
<h1><font color="Blue"> What is the incubation period for COVID-19?</h1>
<font size="5"><font color="Green"> It appears that symptoms are showing up in people within 14 days of exposure to the virus.
<h1><font color="Blue"> What are symptoms of COVID-19? </h1>
<font size="5"><font color="Green"> COVID-19 symptoms include:
<UL type="disc">
<li>Cough
<li>Fever or chills
<li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
<li>Muscle or body aches
<li>Sore throat
<li>New loss of taste or smell
<li>Diarrhea
<li>Headache
<li>New fatigue
<li>Nausea or vomiting
<li>Congestion or runny nose
<br>
In rare cases, COVID-19 can lead to severe respiratory problems, kidney failure or death.

If you have a fever or any kind of respiratory difficulty such as coughing or shortness of breath, call your doctor or a health care provider and explain your symptoms over the phone before going to the doctor’s office, urgent care facility or emergency room. Here are suggestions if you feel sick and are concerned you might have COVID-19.

If you have a medical emergency such as severe shortness of breath, call 911 and let them know about your symptoms.
<h1><font color="Blue"> How is COVID-19 diagnosed? </h1>
<font size="5"><font color="Green"> Diagnosis may be difficult with only a physical exam because mild cases of COVID-19 may appear similar to the flu or a bad cold. A laboratory test can confirm the diagnosis.
<h1><font color="Blue"> How is COVID-19 treated? </h1>
<font size="5"><font color="Green"> As of now, there is not a specific treatment for the virus. People who become sick from COVID-19 should be treated with supportive measures: those that relieve symptoms. For severe cases, there may be additional options for treatment, including research drugs and therapeutics.
<h1><font color="Blue"> Does COVID-19 cause death? </h1>
<font size="5"><font color="Green"> As of November 27, 2020, 1,434,725 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19. However, 39,179,530, people have recovered from the illness.
<h1><font color="Blue"> Is this coronavirus different from SARS? </h1>
<font size="5"><font color="Green"> SARS stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome. In 2003, an outbreak of SARS started in China and spread to other countries before ending in 2004. The virus that causes COVID-19 is similar to the one that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak: both are types of coronaviruses. Much is still unknown, but COVID-19 seems to spread faster than the 2003 SARS and also may cause less severe illness.
<h1><font color="Blue"> How do you protect yourself from this coronavirus?  </h1>
<font size="5"><font color="Green"> It’s crucial to practice good hygiene, respiratory etiquette and physical distancing.
